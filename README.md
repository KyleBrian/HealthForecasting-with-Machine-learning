## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Program
To launch the program, use the command:

```bash
python HealthModel.py -f path/to/dataset.csv -t TargetColumn
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Select Mode**: Choose to train a new model or load a saved model.
2. **File Selection**:
   - **Training**: Select a CSV file with health data.
   - **Loading**: Load a previously saved model file for predictions.
3. **Batch Predictions**: After training or loading a model, select a new CSV file for batch predictions. Results are saved to `predictions_output.csv`.

## üß© Code Explanation

### 1. **File Selection**
   The `select_file()` function allows users to select a CSV or model file, ensuring only valid files are processed.

   ```python
   def select_file(file_type="csv"):
       # Code to select file
   ```

### 2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - `load_data()`: Loads the CSV file.
   - `preprocess_data()`: Handles missing values, scales features, and splits data for training/testing.

   ```python
   def load_data(file_path: str):
       # Load data from CSV file
   ```

### 3. **Model Training**
   - `cross_validate_models()`: Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - `genetic_algorithm_optimization()`: Evolves model configurations and feature subsets using genetic algorithms.

   ```python
   def cross_validate_models(X_train, y_train):
       # Hyperparameter tuning code
   ```

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   The `evaluate_model()` function assesses performance with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

   ```python
   def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
       # Evaluate model performance
   ```

### 5. **Batch Prediction**
   `batch_predict()` enables predictions on new data in bulk and saves the results to a CSV file.

   ```python
   def batch_predict(model, csv_file):
       # Predict outcomes for a batch of data
   ```
