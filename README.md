## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed. A virtual environment is recommended for package management. Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas joblib matplotlib scikit-learn tabulate deap
```

Make sure `tkinter` is installed as well, as it is used for file selection dialogs. It typically comes pre-installed with Python on many systems. On Ubuntu, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KyleBrian/HealthForecasting-with-Machine-learning.git
cd HealthForecasting-with-Machine-learning
```

## üöÄ Usage

To launch the program, simply use the command:

```bash
python HealthModel.py
```

The program will prompt you to:

1. **Choose Mode**: Select whether to train a new model or load an existing one for batch predictions.
2. **File Selection**:
   - For training a model, select a CSV file containing health data.
   - For loading a model, select a saved model file (`.pkl`).
3. **Batch Predictions**: After loading a model, you can select another CSV file for batch predictions. Results are saved to `predictions_output.csv`.

### Example Workflow

Let‚Äôs go through an example step-by-step:

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python HealthModel.py
   ```

2. **Choose Mode**:
   - You will be prompted:  
     ```
     Would you like to (1) Train a new model or (2) Load an existing model? Enter 1 or 2:
     ```
   - Enter `1` to train a new model, or `2` to load a saved model for batch predictions.

3. **File Selection with Dialogs**:
   - When prompted, a file dialog will open:
     - **For training**: Select the CSV file with patient data.
     - **For batch predictions**: Select the CSV file with batch data to analyze after model loading.

4. **Model Saving with Dialogs**:
   - After training, a dialog will prompt you to save each model with a specified file name and location.

## üß© Code Explanation

### 1. **File Selection and Model Saving with `tkinter`**
   The `select_file()` function uses a `tkinter` file dialog to allow users to select CSV or model files for input.
   
   ```python
   def select_file(file_type="csv"):
       # Code to open file dialog
   ```

   Similarly, `save_model_dialog()` opens a save dialog to let users specify a file path for each trained model.

### 2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - `load_data()`: Loads the CSV file.
   - `preprocess_data()`: Handles missing values, scales features, and splits data for training/testing.

   ```python
   def load_data(file_path: str):
       # Load data from CSV file
   ```

### 3. **Model Training**
   - `cross_validate_models()`: Performs hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
   - Saves each model to a file using the `tkinter` save dialog.

   ```python
   def cross_validate_models(X_train, y_train):
       # Hyperparameter tuning code
   ```

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   The `evaluate_model()` function assesses performance with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

   ```python
   def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
       # Evaluate model performance
   ```

### 5. **Batch Prediction**
   `batch_predict()` enables predictions on new data in bulk and saves the results to a CSV file.

   ```python
   def batch_predict(model, csv_file):
       # Predict outcomes for a batch of data
   ```
