## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Program
To launch the program, simply use the command:

```bash
python HealthModel.py
```

The program will then prompt you to enter:

1. **Path to the Dataset**: Enter the path to your health data CSV file (e.g., `health_data.csv`).
2. **Target Column**: Select the column name to predict, such as `HeartDisease` or `Diabetes`.

Afterward, the program will proceed to train multiple machine learning models, evaluate them, and display a comparison of each model‚Äôs performance.

### Example Usage

Let‚Äôs go through an example step-by-step:

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python HealthModel.py
   ```

2. **File Selection Prompt**:
   - The program will prompt:  
     ```
     Enter the path to the CSV file containing health data (e.g., 'health_data.csv'):
     ```
   - Example input:  
     ```
     health_data.csv
     ```

3. **Target Column Selection Prompt**:
   - The program will display the columns in the dataset and prompt:  
     ```
     Columns available for prediction: ['Age', 'BloodPressure', 'HeartDisease']
     Enter the name of the target column (the column to predict):
     ```
   - Example input:  
     ```
     HeartDisease
     ```

After these inputs, the program will proceed to load data, preprocess it, and train and evaluate each model, displaying a summary of model performances (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) in the terminal.

## üß© Code Explanation

### 1. **File Selection**
   The `select_file()` function allows users to select a CSV or model file interactively, ensuring only valid files are processed.

   ```python
   def select_file():
       # Code to select file
   ```

### 2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - `load_data()`: Loads the CSV file.
   - `preprocess_data()`: Handles missing values, scales features, and splits data for training/testing.

   ```python
   def load_data(file_path: str):
       # Load data from CSV file
   ```

### 3. **Model Training**
   - `cross_validate_models()`: Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - `genetic_algorithm_optimization()`: Evolves model configurations and feature subsets using genetic algorithms.

   ```python
   def cross_validate_models(X_train, y_train):
       # Hyperparameter tuning code
   ```

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   The `evaluate_model()` function assesses performance with metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

   ```python
   def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
       # Evaluate model performance
   ```

### 5. **Batch Prediction**
   `batch_predict()` enables predictions on new data in bulk and saves the results to a CSV file.

   ```python
   def batch_predict(model, csv_file):
       # Predict outcomes for a batch of data
   ```
